# SearchEngine-WebBrowser
#Introduction:  
The Web Browser and Search Engine project, in this project we will develop a basic web browser capable of displaying web pages from a given URL. Additionally, we will create a search engine that analyzes web page content, processes user queries, and retrieves relevant pages based on word frequency counts and displays them in descending order.  By adding a way to store data temporarily and storing the data about linking of pages, we will make it efficient and fast. This project provides a comprehensive introduction to the essential components of modern web browsers and search engines retrieval and web development.
#Objective: 
The objective of this project is to develop a functional web browser capable of web pages from specified URLs, along with a search engine that efficiently processes user queries to retrieve relevant web pages based on content analysis. 
#Over Preview:
This C++ project involves developing a search engine that can handle both path and keyword queries within a specified path can be changed according to preferences. Utilizing the experimental filesystem library, the program recursively traverses directories to locate all the files until it reaches the end and analyze their contents. By distinguishing between logical operators like “AND” and “OR” in queries, it accurately counts word occurrences and determines file relevance and displays files according to their relevance. The project also includes a user-friendly GUI built with Windows Forms, enabling users to input queries, view search results, and display file contents easily. This integration of file handling, string manipulation, and GUI development showcases essential techniques for building a functional search engine within a desktop application.
